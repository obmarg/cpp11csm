C++11 Compiler Support Matrix
==

This project contains:

* Tools for parsing the C++11 support tables of Clang, GCC and MSVC
* Tools for generating a static website containing details of the C++11 support of each of the compilers.

This project was started as I frequently work with MSVC and at least 2 versions of GCC, and I was fed up of having to browse to 2 seperate websites to determine whether I could use a particular feature.  Since I'm considering starting to use clang in addition, I figured enough is enough.

So, the website generated by this project displays things in a nice pretty table, and allows various filters to be applied to the data.
